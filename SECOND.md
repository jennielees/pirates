Using the `bar.db` database you created in [the first SQL codelab](/all-your-database/), and the code you walked through in the SQL lessons, create the groundwork for a pirate bar.

1. Create a new table `drinks` with an `id` and `name` for each drink.
2. Create a new table `drink_ingredients` which maps the drink `id` to an ingredient `id`.
3. Make up some drink names and ingredient combinations. A drink can have multiple entries in the `drink_ingredients` table.
4. Insert all this data into the database. You can do this in a SQL file or in code. 
5. In Python, connect to the database and get a cursor.
6. Close the connection when your app is done.
7. List the drinks available at the bar and the ingredients in each drink.

We will continue this next week with an easier approach to Python-database connections!
